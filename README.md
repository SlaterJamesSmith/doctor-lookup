### Description

Javascript application to identify user's age on various planets in Earth's solar system based on birthdate and current date. Because each planet in the solar system carries a different solar year length, meaning that Earth, Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Jupiter are a length of 1, .24, .62, 1.88, and 11.86 Earth years long respectively. This application tells the user how 'old' they are on each of these planets, and how their age relates to their particular life expectancy calculated by planet year length.

#### Program behavior specifications:
| Behavior | Input | Output |
| --------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| User enters a medical issue to receive a list of doctors in the Portland area that fit the search query. | User enters "psoriasis" | A list of doctors is returned |
| User enters a name to receive a list of doctors in the Portland area that fit the search query. | User enters "David" | A list of doctors including the name "David" is returned |
| If the query response includes any doctors, the following information should be included about each doctor: first name, last name, address, phone number, website and whether or not the doctor is accepting new patients. | User inputs a value | If a list of doctors is returned, list their first name, last name, address, phone number, website and whether or not the doctor is accepting new patients.|
| If the API call results in an error (any message not a 200 OK), the application should return a notification that states what the error is. | User enters a value | "There was an error processing your request: (error here). Please try again." |
| If the query response doesn't include any doctors (for instance, if no doctors meet the search criteria), the application should return a notification that states that no doctors meet the criteria. | User enters a value | "There are no doctors in your area that match your criteria at this time" |
